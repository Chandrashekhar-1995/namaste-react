1.-  What is Emmet ?
   ANS:-  Emmet is a powerful and highly efficient web development tool that simplifies and accelerates the process of writing HTML and CSS code. It is often referred to as an "abbreviation engine" because it allows you to use shorthand notation to generate full HTML and CSS code. Emmet is particularly popular among web developers for its ability to boost productivity by reducing the need for manual typing and speeding up the creation of web markup.

2.-  Difference between Library and framework ?
   ANS:-  libraries are like tools you can use when you need them, while frameworks are more like blueprints that dictate the structure and flow of your application. The choice between using a library or a framework depends on the specific requirements of your project. Libraries offer flexibility and allow you to build your own architecture, while frameworks provide a structured, opinionated approach to application development.

3.- What is cdn ? Why do we use it ?
ANS:-  A
A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to deliver web content to users with high availability and performance. CDNs cache static content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript images, and videos, at their edge servers located around the world. When a user requests a piece of content from a website that uses a CDN, the CDN delivers the content from the nearest edge server, which reduces latency and improves performance.

Here are some of the benefits of using a CDN:

Improved performance: CDNs can significantly improve the performance of websites and web applications by reducing latency and delivering content from servers that are closer to users. This can lead to faster page load times, improved responsiveness, and a better overall user experience.
Increased reliability: CDNs can also improve the reliability of websites and web applications by distributing content across multiple servers. This means that if one server goes down, other servers can still deliver the content to users. This can help to reduce downtime and improve the overall availability of websites and web applications.
Reduced bandwidth costs: CDNs can also help to reduce bandwidth costs by offloading traffic from origin servers. This is because CDNs cache content at their edge servers, which means that users do not need to download the content from the origin server every time they visit a website.
Improved security: CDNs can also help to improve the security of websites and web applications by providing protection against common attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Here are some examples of how CDNs are used:

Websites: CDNs are widely used by websites to improve performance, reliability, and security. For example, many popular websites, such as Google, Amazon, and Netflix, use CDNs to deliver their content to users around the world.
Web applications: CDNs are also used by web applications to improve performance, reliability, and security. For example, many popular web applications, such as Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub, use CDNs to deliver their content to users around the world.
Streaming media: CDNs are also used to deliver streaming media content, such as videos and audio, to users with high performance and reliability. For example, many popular streaming media services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify, use CDNs to deliver their content to users around the world.
Overall, CDNs are a valuable tool for improving the performance, reliability, security, and scalability of websites, web applications, and streaming media services




4.-  Why is react Known as React?
ANS:-  
React is known as React because it is a reactive framework. This means that it is able to efficiently update and render user interfaces in response to changes in application state.

React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of the desired state of the UI. When the state of the application changes, React compares the virtual DOM to the real DOM and updates the real DOM only as necessary. This makes React very fast and efficient, especially when rendering complex UIs.

In addition to being reactive, React is also:

Declarative: React is a declarative framework, which means that you tell React what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of the rest. This makes React code easy to read and maintain.
Component-based: React is a component-based framework, which means that you build your UI by composing reusable components. This makes React code modular and reusable.
Scalable: React is a scalable framework, which means that it can be used to build UIs of all sizes, from simple websites to complex web applications.
Overall, React is a popular front-end development framework because it is fast, efficient, declarative, component-based, and scalable. It is also known for its large community and ecosystem of tools and libraries.



5.-  What is cross-origin in the script tag ?
ANS:-  Cross-origin in the script tag is a way to tell the browser how to handle requests for scripts from other domains.

By default, browsers will only execute scripts from the same domain as the current page. This is a security measure to prevent malicious scripts from being executed on a user's computer.

However, there are times when you may need to execute a script from another domain. For example, you might be using a JavaScript library that is hosted on a third-party server.

To do this, you can use the crossorigin attribute on the script tag. This attribute has two possible values: anonymous and use-credentials.

anonymous: This tells the browser to execute the script without sending any credentials, such as cookies or HTTP authentication headers.
use-credentials: This tells the browser to execute the script and send any credentials that are necessary.
When to use crossorigin:

You should only use the crossorigin attribute if you are sure that the script you are loading is safe to execute. If you are not sure, it is best to err on the side of caution and not load the script.

Here are some examples of how to use the crossorigin attribute:

HTML
<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://example.com/my-script.js"></script>

<script crossorigin="use-credentials" src="https://example.com/my-script.js"></script>
Use code with caution. Learn more
Important: If you are using the crossorigin attribute, the server hosting the script must also be configured to allow cross-origin requests. This is typically done by adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the HTTP response.




6.-  What is difference between React and ReactDOM ?
ANS:-  React and ReactDOM are two JavaScript libraries that are often used together to build web applications. However, they have different purposes.

React is a library for building user interfaces. It provides a number of features that make it easy to create and manage complex UIs, such as:

Components: React allows you to build your UIs out of reusable components. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of the desired state of the UI. This makes it very fast and efficient to update the UI in response to changes in state.
One-way data flow: React uses a one-way data flow architecture, which makes it easier to reason about your code and prevent bugs.
ReactDOM is a library for rendering React components to the DOM. It provides a number of methods for interacting with the DOM, such as:

render() - Renders a React component to the DOM.
hydrate() - Hydrates a React component that has already been rendered to the DOM.
unmountComponentAtNode() - Unmounts a React component from the DOM.
In general, you will use React to create and manage your UIs, and you will use ReactDOM to render those UIs to the DOM.

Here is an example of how to use React and ReactDOM together:

JavaScript
// React component
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
};

// ReactDOM
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will render the MyComponent component to the DOM element with the ID root




7.-  What is difference between react.devlopment.js and react.production.js files via CDN ?
ANS:-  
The main difference between the react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN is that the development version is optimized for debugging, while the production version is optimized for performance.

The development version includes a number of features that are helpful for debugging, such as:

Source maps: Source maps allow you to map the minified production code back to the original source code, which can be helpful for debugging errors.
Error messages: The development version provides more detailed error messages than the production version.
React warnings: The development version warns you about potential problems in your code, such as unused props and incorrect state updates.
The production version is optimized for performance by removing unnecessary code and minifying the code. This results in a smaller file size that loads faster and uses less memory.

When to use react.development.js:

When you are developing your application and need to debug errors.
When you want to see detailed error messages and React warnings.
When to use react.production.js:

When you are deploying your application to production.
When you want to improve the performance of your application.
Which file to use via CDN?

If you are developing your application, you should use the react.development.js file via CDN. This will give you access to the features that are helpful for debugging.

Once you are ready to deploy your application to production, you should switch to using the react.production.js file via CDN. This will improve the performance of your application.

Important: If you are using the react.development.js file, you should also include the react-dom.development.js file via CDN. This is because the development version of React depends on the development version of ReactDOM.




8.-  What are async and defer ? see my Youtube Videos.
ANS:-  async and defer are attributes that can be used on the <script> tag in HTML to control how JavaScript files are loaded and executed.

async

The async attribute tells the browser to download and execute the JavaScript file as soon as it is available, without waiting for the rest of the page to load.
This can improve the performance of your page, but it can also cause problems if the JavaScript file depends on other elements on the page that have not yet loaded.
For example, if the JavaScript file contains code to initialize a navigation menu, and the navigation menu has not yet been loaded, the JavaScript code will not be able to initialize the menu properly.
defer

The defer attribute tells the browser to download the JavaScript file but wait to execute it until the rest of the page has loaded.
This ensures that the JavaScript file will not interfere with the loading of other elements on the page.
However, it can also delay the execution of the JavaScript code, which can impact the performance of your page.
When to use async and defer

You should use the async attribute if you want to improve the performance of your page and the JavaScript file does not depend on other elements on the page.
You should use the defer attribute if you want to ensure that the JavaScript file does not interfere with the loading of other elements on the page.
Which one to use?

In general, it is best to use the defer attribute unless you have a specific reason to use the async attribute.

Here are some examples of when you might use the async attribute:

If you are using a JavaScript library that needs to be loaded as soon as possible, such as a library that provides analytics or crash reporting.
If you are using a JavaScript file to load other resources, such as images or CSS files.
Here are some examples of when you might use the defer attribute:

If you are using a JavaScript file to initialize UI elements, such as a navigation menu or a modal dialog.
If you are using a JavaScript file to handle user interaction, such as clicking a button or submitting a form.





9.-   What is rrow Functions in react ?
And:- Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ES6, and they are widely used in React.
Arrow functions have a number of benefits over traditional function expressions, including:
:- They are more concise.
:- They are lexically bound, which means that they do not need to be bound to a specific context.
:- They can be used as expressions, which makes them more flexible.
To define an arrow function, you use the following syntax:

For example, the following arrow function is equivalent to the following traditional function expression:

JavaScript
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Arrow functions can be used anywhere that a function expression is expected. For example, you can use them to define event handlers, component lifecycle methods, and render functions.

Here is an example of how to use an arrow function as an event handler:

JavaScript
<button onClick={() => alert('Hello, world!')}>Click me!</button>
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will render a button that alerts the message "Hello, world!" when it is clicked.

Arrow functions are a powerful tool that can make your React code more concise, readable, and flexible.

Here are some additional benefits of using arrow functions in React:

Improved readability: Arrow functions can make your React code more readable by reducing the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write.
Reduced code duplication: Arrow functions can help you to reduce code duplication by allowing you to define concise, reusable functions.
Enhanced performance: Arrow functions can help to improve the performance of your React code by reducing the amount of overhead that is required to execute functions.
